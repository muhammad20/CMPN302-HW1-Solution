# CMPN302-HW1-Solution
solution of HW1 of Algorithms Design and Analysis course.

## steps to run
1 - make sure `python2` is installed in your system.
2 - install `dart` SDK https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk
3 - add the path to the SDK to your `PATH` variable.
3 - run `python runscript.py <data_count> <output_filename>` will output to `filename` random numbers of count `data_count`.
4 - run `dart main.dart` (you will get an error: missing arguments, but you will know the algorithms code). 
5 - run `dart main.dart <algorithm_code> <input_file> <sorted_data_filename> <algo_execution_time_filename>` where input file is the file generated from the python script, algorithm code.
